## Application of A-mode (non-image-based) ultrasound in musculoskeletal system
Ultrasonic waves have been recognised as valuable tools in non-destructive testing of materials. However, while the B-mode ultrasound system is widely used in medicine (for viewing of soft tissues), the A-mode ultrasound system is not extensively applied clinically. Here, we present the application of A-mode ultrasound in prosthetics and preliminary testing of its application in detecting knee meniscus extrusion.
